==================

Automated Trading Platform.

Original release was written in Visual Studio C++ against MBS Trading SDK.  Currently configured for Forex.  
Working system.  No further modifications will be made, but it is available for reference or anyone wanting to 
continue with it. The interface to MB Trading was done through COM.  The trading interface should be FIX since
this is a common interface in the community.

The goal of this project is to rewrite the trading platform into Java, as webservices, utilizing microservices
where possible.  A sister project Manghula is intended to provide trade triggers for the platform.
